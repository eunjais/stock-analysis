# stock-analysis
Second module challenge, stock analysis for Steve.

## Overview

This analysis is a refactored code that loops through an expanded dataset of green energy stocks VS the DAQO stocks. Refactoring essentially allows for looping through the data in the VBA script used, to make the code run much more efficiently than what we had in our previous solution code.
