# stock-analysis
Second module challenge, stock analysis for Steve.

## Overview

This analysis is a refactored code that loops through an expanded dataset of green energy stocks VS the DAQO stocks. Refactoring essentially allows for looping through the data in the VBA script used, to make the code run much more efficiently than what we had in our previous solution code. 

## Results

Here are the elapsed time for the datasets without the refactored code.

## Conclusions

Refactoring a code allows for larger datasets to be processed faster in VBA format. It is a crucial part in data analysis, where it allows for better efficiency of macros and also allows for easier read and understanding of massive amounts of data. However, the process of refactoring is often time-consuming if not planned from the start, and added complexity to the code may render it obsolete.  The original code would be much more convenient when working with a sufficiently sized dataset.
